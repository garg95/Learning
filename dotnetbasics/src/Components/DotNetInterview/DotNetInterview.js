            <h3>Can we have static constructor inside a static class?</h3>

            <p>No - we cannot have that because static classes cannot have instance constructors</p>

            <h3>What's the use of Global.asax file?</h3>
            <p>Effectively, global.asax allows you to write code that runs in response to "system level" events, such as the application starting, a session ending, an application error occuring, without having to try and shoe-horn that code into each and every page of your site.</p>
            <p>Once you've added the file, you can add code under any of the events that are listed</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Application_Start</li>
                <li>Application_End</li>
                <li>Session_Start</li>
                <li>Session_End</li>

            <h3>Difference between IEnumerable and IEnumerator</h3>
            <p>IEnumerable and IEnumerator both are interfaces in C#.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>IEnumerable is an interface defining a single method GetEnumerator() that returns an IEnumerator interface.</li>
                <li>IEnumerator has two methods MoveNext and Reset. It also has a property called Current</li>
